//! A chat server that broadcasts messages to all connections.
//!
//! The server expects to send and receive messages via codecs provided by tokio-chat-common.
//! The message protocol between the client and server is:
//!
//! 1. A new client connects to the server. It must send a single `Handshake` message.
//! 2. After receiving the `Handshake`, the server broadcasts a `ServerMessage::UserConnected`
//!    message to all connected clients (including the new one that triggered this message).
//! 3. The client may send any number of `ClientMessage`s to the server. For each incoming
//!    `ClientMessage`, the server broadcasts a `ServerMessage::Message` to every connected
//!    client (including the client that sent this `ClientMessage`).
//! 4. When a client disconnects, the server broadcasts a `ServerMessage::UserDisconnected`
//!    message to all remaining connected clients. This step is skipped if the client disconnecting
//!    never completed the `Handshake` in step 1.
//!
//! To test this, run
//!
//!     cargo run
//!
//! in this project and then in another window run one or more instances the tokio-chat-client
//! binary.
